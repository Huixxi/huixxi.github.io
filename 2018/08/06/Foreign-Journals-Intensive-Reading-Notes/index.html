<blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court on Monday announced that it would consider a case that asks whether consumers can <strong><u>sue</u></strong> Apple <u>over</u> the way it manages millions of apps for iPhones and iPads, threatening to expose not only Apple but also its tech industry peers to new <strong>antitrust scrutiny</strong>.  </p>
<p>The <strong>lawsuit</strong> could force Apple to rethink the way it manages its App Store, long considered one of the most highly <strong>curated</strong> platforms in the business. For one thing, Apple generally takes a 30 percent cut of all third-party apps sold through its <strong>portal</strong>. In the eyes of the <strong>plaintiffs</strong>, that fee ultimately hurts consumers, because developers pass those added costs onto iPhone and iPad users who purchase the paid apps.  </p>
<p>Apple has argues that its policies target developers, not consumers. It has <strong><u>likened</u></strong> itself <u>to</u> a shopping mall that “<strong>lease</strong> space to various stores”, which then sell to shoppers. In a digital context. Apple says consumers aren’t buying apps from the company -- ther’re buying them from the creators of those apps through the App Store <strong>interface</strong>. The arguments <strong>rest on</strong> a Supreme Court decision from the 1970s that found consumers can’t seek damages in cases where a company <strong>allegedly</strong> charged a third party and that third party then passed the costs onto its customers.  </p>
<p>A loss for Apple could mean trouble for other companies, like Google and Microsoft, which have their own <strong>repositores</strong> for third party apps on smartphones and other devices. It could mean a “potential flood of lawsuits,” said Morgan Reed, the leader of ACT:The App Association, a Washington-based trade group for app-makers that is sponsored by Apple. It has asked the Supreme Court to <strong>halt</strong> the lawsuit.  </p>

<p>The lake would be the first body of liquid water ever detected on the red planet, if observations by a European spacecraft are confirmed.  </p>
<p>A large saltwater lake seems to lurk under ice near Mars’s south pole. If confirmed, it would be the first body of liquid water ever detected on the red planet and a significant <strong>milestone</strong> <u>in the quest to</u> determine whether life exists there.  </p>
<p>“It’s a very promising place to look for life on Mars,” says Roberto Orosei, <em>a planetary scientist <u>at</u> the National Institute of Astrophysics <u>in</u> Bologna, Italy</em>. “But we do not know for sure if it is inhabited.” On Earth, similar <strong>‘subglacial’</strong> lakes are home to microbial life.</p>
<p>A team of Italian researchers, led by Orosei, reported the discovery on 25 July in <em>Science</em>. They <strong>spotted</strong> evidence of the buried lake in radar data from the European Space Agency’s Mars Express spacecraft.</p>
<p>Others say that the work is tantalizing but, like anything else in the controversial hunt for water on Mars, it needs more supporting evidence. “It’s not quite a <strong>slam dunk</strong> yet,” says Jeffrey Plaut, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who has searched for water using data from <em>Mars Express</em>.</p>
<p>If further studies confirm the existence of a lake, it could open new <strong>avenues</strong> for investigating Mars. Researchers have drilled into subglacial lakes on Earth and sampled the water for signs of microbes, while others are developing technologies to reach a buried ocean on Jupiter’s moon Europa. There are no ice-drilling missions currently <strong>slated</strong> for Mars – but the latest discovery could change how scientist think about exploring the planet.</p>
<p>“It begins new line of inquiry that’s very exciting,” says Jim Green, NASA’s chief scientist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hours after saying he had a “very good meeting” with the publisher of the New York Times about his labelling the press the “enemy of the people”, Donald Turmp launched a <strong>blistering</strong> attack on “anti-Trump haters in the dying newspaper industry”.</p>
<p>“The failing New York Times and the Amazon Washington Post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements,” Trump tweeted. “And they will never change!”</p>
<p>Earlier, the White House confirmed Trump met Times publisher AG Sulzberger on 20 July. Sulzberger then issued a statement that opened an <strong>exchange</strong> over whose activities were more damaging to America.</p>
<p>Sulzberger said he had raised “concerns about the president’s deeply troubling anti-press <strong>rhetoric</strong>“ and “<strong>implored</strong> him to reconsider his broader attacks on journalism, which I believe are dangerous and harmful to our country”.</p>
<p>Sulzberger did not say how the president responded. Hours later, Trump <strong>obliged</strong>.</p>
<p>Claiming without evidence that “90% of media <strong>coverage</strong> of my administration is negative”, Trump said he would “not allow our great country to be <strong>sold out</strong> by anti-Trump haters in the dying newspaper industry”.</p>
<p>Sulzberger, 37, took over from his father on 1 January. In his statement, he said:”I told the president directly that I thought that his language was not just <strong>divisive</strong> but increasingly dangerous. I told him that although the phrase ‘fake news’ is untrue and harmful, I am far more concerned about his labelling journalists ‘the enemy of the people’.</p>

<p>Though most consumers aren’t yet sure what to do with VR, some psychologists are using it to treat <strong>anorexia</strong> and <strong>bulimia</strong>.</p>
<p>The details: According to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, therapists are using VR along with more standard therapy practices to ease patients’ body and food related issues.</p>
<p>For instance, one doctor combines <strong>cognitive</strong> behavioral therapy(CBT) with VR to initially place patients in a relaxing scene. After that, he uses VR to show them an environment that will be more stressful, like a restaurant, and helps them work through any anxiety.</p>
<p>Does it help? A meta-analysis from French and Australian researchers, which was published in April, looked at 26 previous studies and found they indicate that VR is “an acceptable and promising therapeutic tool” for eating-disorder patients. </p>
<p>Might make sense: VR has rapidly gotten better and cheaper; you can buy a <strong>self-contained</strong> Oculus Go headset for $199. As VR technology improves, virtual situations will get more realistic while staying far easier to contral than real-world settings, And there’s already <strong>precedent</strong> for using VR for better health: the technology has long been studied for its potential as a <strong>painkiller</strong>, for instance.</p>

<p><em>These uncertain times have been a renewed interest in serious nonfication, as people try to make sense of an unstable world</em><br>This is a story about a book that just kept selling <u>catching</u> publishers, booksellers and even its author <u>off guard</u>. <em>In seeking to</em> understand the reasons for the book’s unusually <strong>protracted shelf life</strong>, we uncover important messages about our moment in history, about the still-vital place of reading in our culture, and about the changing face of publishing.</p>
<p>The book is <em>Sapiens</em>, by the Istaeli academic Yuval Noal Harari, published in the UK in September 2014. It’s a <strong>recondite</strong> work of evolutionary history charting the developmemt of humankind through a scholarly examination of our ability to cooperate as a species.</p>
<p><em>Sapiens</em> has sold a further half million copies, establishing itself firmly at the top of the bestseller lists. The book’s wild success is symptomatic of a boarder trend in our book-buying habits: a surge in the popularity of intelligent challenging nonfiction, often books that are several years old.  </p>
<p>It was trade publication, the <em>Bookseller</em>, that first noted the rise of what it called the “brainy <strong>backlist</strong>“. It also highlighted a <strong>concomitant</strong> fall in the sales of the books that had been such a <strong>staple</strong> od publishers’ catalogues–celebrity biographies. <em>We are turning away from glitzy but <strong>disposable</strong> stories of fame and excess and towards more serious, thoughtful, quiet books that help us understand our place in the world.</em> Mark Richards, publisher at Hohn Murray Press, sees the return to serious works of nonfiction as a response to the spirit of the age. “People have a hunger both for information and facts, and for <strong>nuanced</strong> exploration of issues, of a sort that books are in a prime position to provide.” he says.</p>
<p>At a time when politice is more furious and fragmented than ever, when technology is colonising our everyday existence, when medicine is reshaping our lives, we still look to books to make sense of things, to feel ourselves part of a great “communal” effert to understand our age. These are serious times and they demand serious, intelligent and challenging books.</p>

<p>New Zealand’s most violence and disturbed <strong>inmates</strong> will soon be able to walk on real grass, take sun baths and practise yoga in their cells as the country opens its first “humane” prison for <strong>maximum-secuity offenders</strong>.</p>
<p>The NZ$300m prison has just been completed on the outskirts of Auckland and, when it opens,, will be the only specialist facility for maximum and high-security male prisoners in the country. The prison has been designed to operate as a “<strong>de facto</strong> mental health unit” as the number of mentally ill <strong>incarcerated</strong> men continues to <strong>soar</strong>.  </p>
<p>A seed propagation garden will allow prisoners to <u>get their hands dirty</u> and nurture new life, while a <strong>sensory</strong> garden aims to <strong>soothe</strong> and stimulate, with plants such as <strong>thyme</strong> and <strong>spearmint</strong>, and real grass underfoot. Horizontal rather than vertical bars allow inmates a better view of the natural world.</p>
<p>New Zealand has one of the highest <strong>incarceration</strong> rates in the developed world, and some 90% of prisoners have a life-long diagnosis of mental illness ot addiction.</p>
<p>Neil Beales, <strong>corrections</strong> chief <strong>custodial</strong> officer, said the new prison was “more decent and humane” than the former facility, with the goal of <strong>rehabilitating</strong> prisoners.</p>
<p>“<strong>Rehabilitation</strong> and <strong>reintegration</strong> has to start the minute that they come into prison: because they are going to leave prison. And if we don’t have a facility where we can do good programmes we are unlikely ever to see a decline in the prison numbers that we ultimately want.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Mission: Impossible–Fallout,” starring Tom Cruise, 56, and made by Paramount Pictures, could have easily turned into a sad commentary on the state of moviedom in the age of Marval and Netflix. Instead, “Fallout” arrived as a cultural thunderclap, receiving joyous reviews from critics, stirring lively ticket-buyer conversation online and taking in a stout $61.5 million over its first three days in North American theaters. Overseas. “Fallout” collected an additional $92 million.</p>
<p>“I’m seeing the numbers come in from around the world, and they’re just fantastic,” Jim Gianopulos, who took over as Paramount’s chairman last year, said by telephone early Sunday from Greece, where he has a home. He <strong>credited</strong> Cruise, who did his own <strong>stunts</strong>, and Christopher McQuarri, who directed and wrote “Fallout.” “It’s a mature franchise, but they have kept it incredibly fresh,” Gianopulos said.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old “Mission Impossible” film series, which is based on the 52-year-old TV show, dose not have the same financial power it once did.The reception for “Fallout” was impressive nonetheless, improving on opening-weekend ticket sales for its 2015 <strong>predecessor</strong>, “Rogue Nation,” even after adjusting for inflation “Fallout” also received stronger reviews–an achievement of critical importance for the <strong>franchise</strong> going forward; if audiences are satisfied with one <strong>sequal</strong>, they are likely to go to the next one.</p>
<p>Paramount is still in last place among Hollywood’s six biggest movie studios in terms of <strong>domestic</strong> market share, but Gianopulos has returned Paramount to <strong>modest</strong> profitability. He has also pushed ahead <strong>long-gestating</strong> movies like “Top Gun:<strong>Maverick</strong>,” which stars Cruise in a return to his role from the 1986 origional and is scheduled for release next July.</p>
<p>“You’re always just a few good movies from turning things around,” Gianopulos said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even the light of 200 birthday candles couldn’t <strong>pierce</strong> the <strong>gloom</strong> of “Wuthering Heights.” But the fire that burned within Emily Bronte roars across the centuries.</p>
<p>The younger sister of Charlotte, Emily was born on July 30, 1818, in Yorkshire, England. Together wirh her sbilings, Emily stoken a furnace of creatuvuty unique in the annals of literary history. The children wrote fantastical stories together, spinning imaginary worlds of romantic adventure.</p>
<p>Only poetic <strong>remnants</strong> of that <strong>juvenilia</strong> survive today, but during their brief lives, each of the Bronte sisters managed to publish at least on novel, and none of them generates more <strong>cultish</strong> devotion than “Wuthering Heights.” Yes, Charlottes’s “Jane Eyre” may have more readers, but the tale of young Catherine and Heathciff remains the most feverish love story in English literature.</p>
<p>Emily, after all, is the woman who wrote, “No coward soul is mine / No trembler in the world’s storm-trouble sphere.” And the characters she created are just as fearless, just as <strong>audacious</strong> in their disregard for what is expected, what is reasonable, what makes sense. The wonder of “Wuthering Heights” is its exponential emotions: “such <strong>anguish</strong> in the <strong>gush</strong> of grief”.</p>
<p>We know Catherine is doomed and Heathcliff is “a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man,” but how <strong>subversive</strong>, how <strong>bewitching</strong> such <strong>bewitching</strong> such <strong>unbridled</strong> passion feels in our <strong>self-conscious</strong> age of <strong>transactional hookups</strong> and enlightened unions. No dating app would ever predict a happy future. And yet …”He’s more myself than I am,” Catherine cries.”Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In less than two weeks, the highly anticipated “Crazy Rich Asians” movie will hit theaters. The film, based on a novel of the same name by Kevin Kwan, has generated widespread excitement, particlarly among Asian Americans.</p>
<p>It’s the first Hollywood studio film in 25 years to feature Asian Americans in leading roles. It has an all-Asian cast with actors from around the world. More importantly, <em>it shows Asians in a refershing light</em>: The men are attractive and <strong>charismatic</strong>, the women are <strong>headstring</strong> and independent, and there isn’t a stereotypical <strong>nerd</strong> or <strong>martial arts master</strong> in sight.</p>
<p>The film could have an impact not only on the Asian American community, but, if successful, on Hollywood. It <u>steers clear of</u> spreading stereotypes about Asian men that they have long struggled against: the perception that they are not romantically desirable even among other Asians.</p>
<p>In a 2014 study published by the dating site OkCupid, statistics showed that Asian men were generally considered by women as less attractive than the average man. In movies and TV shows, Asian characters have evolved from <strong>sinister villains to goofy or nerdy sidekicks.</strong> More often than not, these characters are not masculine enough or seen as asexal.</p>
<p>Last year, in <em>Psychology Today</em>, Sam Louie, a Washington-based psychotherapist who specializes in multicultural issues, wrote that these stereotypes will only continue to be <strong>perpetuated</strong> unless Asian men are cast in leading romantic roles in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>“He’s Jim or John first and oh, he happens to be of Asian background as well,” Louie said. “That would be the greatest hope, that these stereotypes wash away and the individual piece comes out.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the first time, a public database of DNA profiles was used to solve a very recent crime. The implications for crime fighting aer tremendous.</p>
<p><strong>Red handed:</strong> A 31-year-old man, Spencer Glen Minnett, was arrested by police in Utah on July 28 for the rape of an elderly woman, Faraia Brooks. The crime happened only last April.</p>
<p>Monnett was located via “genetic genealogy”:DNA he left at the crime scene was used to find his relatives and then him.</p>
<p><strong>Not just cold-case murders:</strong> This year police began using genetic genealogy to crack notorious decades-old murders, like the Golden State Killer case, which had gone unsolved since the mid-1973s. So far, a half-dozen alleged murderers hacve been named.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Genealogists upload the sequences of DNA left at a crime scene to a large database of genetic profiles to find relatives of an unknown suspect. Then they <u>zero in on</u> him (yes, they’re all men, so far) by building a family tree and using that information to inform traditional detective work.</p>
<p><strong>Implications?</strong> <strong><em>You bet.</em></strong> It appears police can now ID a criminal within weeks of a crime than murder. </p>
<p>“I believe this will be the trend,” says CeCe Moore, the genealogist and DNA detective who worked the Monnett case. She thinks searching genectic databases soon after crimes are committed will save police resources and could even have stopped this rapist from striking again.</p>
<p>“We are so relieved,” she says.</p>

<p>People who live in China’s crowded cities are used to having their personal space invaded–in schools, malls, restaurants, bus stations, dorminatories and even bathrooms. But that doesn’t mean they like it.</p>
<p>Now a growing number of them identify with a Finnish cartoon character who <strong>channels</strong> their urban anxieties, <strong>albeit</strong> in a different cultural context.</p>
<p>The “Finnish Nightmares” comic series <strong>documents</strong> the social challenges faced by Matti, a mild-mannered stick figure who <strong>abhors</strong> small talk. The series has been trending on Chinese social media, and it even <strong>spawned</strong> a new word for social awkwardness in Mardarin: jingfen, or “spiritually Finnish”.</p>
<p>Matti is a “stereotypical Finn” who “tries his best to do unto others as he wishes to be done unto him: to give space, be polite and not bother with unnecessary chitchat,” accroding to a description on the official websites of “Finnish Nightmares.”</p>
<p>“As an anthropophobic, I love this series so much”, Li Xin, a college student in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, wrote recently on Sina Weibo, one of China’s most popular social media sites, where a “Finnish Nightmares” <strong>hashtag</strong> has gotten about 24,000 clicks.</p>
<p>“China has a huge population, and Chinese people usually <strong>congregate</strong> in large groups, but there are still a lot of introverts, like me,” Ms.Li, 22, said in an interview conducted via Weibo messages. “In a social like China’s we are considered hard to deal with and thought of as weirdos. But the truth is we just don’t enjoy unnecessary socializing that much. It’s too tiring.”</p>

<p>In the cramped former home of Jack Ma, founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, about thirty young engineers sit eblow to elbow, working to attrack the next million users for DingTalk, Alibaba’s workplace communication software.</p>
<p>Since December 2014, DingTalk has grown exponentially to become the world’s largest chat service designed for companies.</p>
<p>But its rapid rise–propelled by a promise to boost productivity through better monitoring of employee movements and faster response to important messages has sparked a backlash from Chinese workers who say the app fuels an unhealthy work culture.</p>
<p>Like WhatsApp, DingTalk lets senders see if recipients have read messages, but it also has a “ding” feature that can <strong>bombard</strong> recipents with repeat notifications, text messages and phone-call reminders.</p>
<p>As DingTalk has grown, many Chinese office workers have vented their frustrations online about the service, saying it is inhumane and destorys trust. On Zhihu.com, a question-and-answer website, a thread entitled “how does it feel like to be forced to use DingTalk at work” has more than a thousand<br>posts and has been viewed over 7.7 million times.</p>
<p>“There’s a saying in my circle, that you should quit the day your company installs DingTalk,” said Robert, who works in luxury retail in the northwestern province of Shaanxi and complains that DingTalk has “fragmented his time into pieces.”</p>
<p>The service’s chief executive, Wu Zhao, is aware of the backlash DingTalk is facing, but says the problem is a “toxic work culture at some companies” and misuse by some employers.</p>
<p>“DingTalk’s goal is to encourage transparent and equal communications among all staff,” Wu said. “The tool itself is not the problem; the way it is used is the problem”.</p>

<p>The <strong>kennels reeked of excrement</strong>. The dogs inside looked weak. Many were suffering from visible injuries. Such was the scene that greeted Zoe Tang at the Canidrome, a greyhound-racing stadium in Macau, an autonomous region of China, on the morning of July 21st.</p>
<p>The evening before, its billionaire bos had left behind all 533 race dogs owing to the expiry of the venue’s operating concession, forcing the authorities to step into mind them. Since then Ms Tang, who works for Anima, a local animal-welfare organisation, has been recruiting volunteers to help feed, walk and baths the forsaken <strong>canines</strong>. Hundreds of people have turned up daily, far more than had been betting on the races.</p>
<p>The Canidrome is one of the last <strong>vestiges</strong> of a <strong>grittier</strong>, <strong>seedier</strong> Macau. The greyhound track opened in 1963 (after a false start in the 1930s), when Macau was a Portuguese colony, and drew crowds of day-trippers from Hong Kong. Owned by the family of Staley Ho, who once enjoyed a <strong>stranglehold</strong> on local gambing concessions, it was the last place in Asia where <strong>punters</strong> could <strong>wager</strong> legally on dog racing. But in the new Macua, with its <strong>glitzy</strong> <strong>casinos</strong>, it had lost its <strong>lustre</strong>. Attendance <strong>dwindled</strong> to just dozens a day.</p>
<p>Aniaml-rights groups had urged the track be closed. They alleged that greyhounds were put down if they failed repeatedly to win races. In 2011 the head of Macua’s animal-control division said that 30 dogs a month were being killed. Angela Leong, wife of Mr Ho, boss of the Canidroms and an elected lawmaker, denied any cruelty. She said her charges were the “happiest dogs in the world”.</p>

<p>The <strong>Pentagon</strong> is moving toward fulfilling President Donald Trump’s request to establish a Space Force, in what would be the first new branch of the military in more than 70 years.</p>

<p>But the calls for a separate military branch have been met with strong <strong>reluctance</strong> in some parts of the Pentagon amid concerns that it doesn’t need the burdens of a new <strong>bureaucracy</strong>. The move could significantly reorganize the military and potentially strip the Air Force of some of its key reponsibilities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Japan has made a lot of noise in recent years about <strong>domelishing</strong> the traditional view that women should stay at home while men go out to work. So it was shocking when, on August 7th, Tokyo Medical school, <strong>confessed</strong> to marking down the test scores of female applicants to keep the ratio of women in each class below 30%.</p>
<p>Their defence was that women are more likely to drop out to marry and have children. To judge female applicants to medical school purely on their <strong>merits</strong> would leave Japan with a shortage of doctors, they said. The admission has caused outrage.</p>
<p>Doctoring has long been a male <strong>bastion</strong>. But it is not the only one. Discrimination is <strong>rife</strong> in banks and trading houses, where <strong>stamina</strong> and loyalty, qualities somehow associated with men, are prized, says Mari Mirus, a political scientist at Sophia University.</p>
<p>All this embarrasses a government that has promised to make women “shine”, its <strong>condescending catchphrase</strong> for female empowerment. The policy seems based on the need for more workers rather than on genuine concern for women. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, says he wants to bring millions more women into the workforce to make up for a <strong>labour shortfall</strong> caused by its ageing and declining population.</p>
<p>In the field of politics, the record under Mr Abe’s premiership is lamentable. Just two members of his 20-strong cabinet are women, including Seike Noda, in charge of women’s empowerment. Ms Noda, who <strong>makes little secret of</strong> her ambition to <strong>dethrone</strong> Mr Ade in a leadership contest next month, has just published a book called “Grad the Future”, her <strong>manifesto</strong> for pulling Japan into line with “global standards”. She has almost no chance of winning.</p>

<p>Ironically, the announcement has been anything but popular. On social media, responses to this idea have ranged from hostile to very hostile indeed. Many feel that the once-<strong>prestigious</strong> Oscars are <strong>dumbing dowm</strong> to the level of the MTV Awards. What’s next–Best Kiss? Loudest Shoot-Out? Most Skycrapers Flattened by Aliens in a Single Action Sequence?</p>
<p>The concept of the “Hit Oscar” or the “Popcorn Oscar”, as it has been nicknamed, raises other question, too. To start with, who decides whether or not a film is popular? What are the <strong>criteria</strong> or thresholds? And isn’t it an insult to <strong>nominees</strong>, the <strong>implicit</strong> suggestion being that hit films can’t be artstic(and vice versa)?</p>
<p>There was a time when the likes of “Braveheart”, “Tatinic” and “Gladiator” could make zillions at the <strong>box office</strong>, while also <strong>scooping</strong> up <strong>armful</strong> of golden statuettes. But in the past decade the top Oscar has <strong>gone to auteur</strong> projects such as “The Shape of Water”, “Moonlight” and “Birdman”: terrific films, but by on means the so-called “<strong>tentpoles</strong>“ that <strong>keep a roof over</strong> the studios, heads.</p>
<p>The new division between best picture and popular picture may be ill-judge, but it reflects a pre-existing <strong>dichotomy</strong> between <strong>arthouse</strong> and <strong>multiplex</strong> fare. So have pity on the poor Academy. If Hollywood studios weren’t quite so obsessed with superhero <strong>franchises</strong>, the Oscars might not be in this mess in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An Indiana man named Jesse D.Allen created a website in 2005 with the tutle AllForUSA.com, apparently to pursue some business interests, but he soon abandoned the site. A decade later, at the age of 80, Allen died.</p>
<p>But AllForUSA was just getting started.</p>
<p>As the 2016 presidential campaign heated up, AllForUSA.com suddently <strong>bristled</strong> with what appeared to be news articles celebrating Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and <strong>bashing</strong> his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. “HILLARY May END UP in PRISON AFTER ALL”, read one headline.</p>
<p>On Reddit the commenter “allforusa” posted similar messages and linked to headlines on AllForUSA.com. The following year, after Trump’s election, a Twitter account named “@allforusa11” retweeted the president before <strong>inexplicably</strong> changing subjects to tweet about feminism–in Japanese.</p>
<p>The final twist came a few months later hen AllForUSA.com was reborn again–this time as a Russian online gambing site.</p>
<p>A clue to the mystery of this multilingual burst of activity appeared in a February <strong>indictment</strong> by special counsel Robert S.Mueller III. It said the Russians who operated fake social media accounts to manipulate American voters used allforusa@yahoo.com to <strong>fraudulently</strong> access a PayPal account and to promote a “March for Trump” campaign rally in New York.</p>
<p>The other “AllForUSA” accounts probably were operated <strong>in tandem</strong> with this email address and with each other, accounding to a report Monday from cyberintelligence firm GroupSense, whose researchers found a subtle <strong>tangle</strong> of connections left in records discovered online.</p>
<p>The report highlights how data <strong>breaches</strong> fuel <strong>nefarious</strong> online activity, giving criminal hackers and disinformation teams an endless supply of cheap accounts to use individually or for networks of ‘bots’, automated accounts controlled by a single operative. All this typically takes place without the original owners knowing what happend to their creations.</p>

<p>There is never a dull moment with the <strong>mercurial</strong> Mr Musk, but he <strong>excelled</strong> himself on Tuesday, <strong>stunning</strong> the markets by tweeting that he was considering taking the company private by buying publicly available shares for $420 each–a significant <strong>premium</strong> to the $340 they were trading at before he dropped his <strong>bombshell</strong>.</p>
<p>If it turns out his Twitter promise–that he has secured the tens of billions of dollars he would need to <strong>buy out</strong> public shareholders - is in any way <strong>shaky</strong>, then he could find himself accused of price manipulation.

<p>There is no doubt there is some sense in taking the company private. Private companies are not <strong>subject to</strong> the same scrutiny from investors, who want to see very transparent earnings on a quarter-by-quarter basis - and if you don’t deliver it, your share price can be heavily punished.</p>
<p>Also, Mr Musk did not enjoy having to answer the <strong>forensic</strong> questioning of Wall Street analysts who want <strong>minutiae</strong> on production, sales, timings, earnings <strong>et al</strong>. If he takes the company private, he won’t have to do this. If it turns out that he doesn’t have the financial firepower to deliver on his tweet, the regulators may think he’s more than a <strong>bonehead</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>V.S. Naipaul, the Nobel <strong>laureate</strong> who documented the <strong>migrations</strong> of peoples, the <strong>unraveling</strong> of the British Empire, the <strong>ironies</strong> of <strong>exile</strong> and the clash between belife and unbelief in more than a dozen <strong>unsparing</strong> novels and as many works of nofiction, died Saturady at his home in London. He was 85.</p>
<p>His family confirmed the death in a statement, The Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>In many ways <strong>embodying</strong> the contradictions of the <strong>postcolonial</strong> world, Naipaul was born of Indian <strong>ancestry</strong> in Trinidad, went to Oxford University on a scholarship and lived the rest of his life in England, where he <strong>forged</strong> one of the most <strong>illustrious</strong> literary careers of the last half century.</p>
<p>Naipaul <strong>personified</strong> a sense of <strong>displacement</strong>. Having left behind the <strong>circumscribed</strong> world of Trinidad, he was never entirely rooted in England. In awarding him the Nobel Prize in literature in 2001, the Swedish Academy described him as “a literary <strong>circumanavigator</strong>, only ever really at home in himself, in his <strong>inimitable</strong> voice.”</p>
<p>Yet his <strong>existential</strong> homelessness was as much willed as fated. Although he spent his literary career <strong>mining</strong> his origins, Naipaul fiercely resisted the idea of being <strong>tethered</strong> to a <strong>hyphen</strong>, or to a particular ethnic or religious identity. His guiding philosophy was universalism which he descirbed as “Our Universal Civilization”.</p>

<p>Roman Catholic priests in Pennsylvania sexually abused thousands of children over a 70-year period and silenced victims through “the <strong>weaponization</strong> of faith” and a systematic cover-up campaign by their <strong>bishops</strong>, the state <strong>attorney</strong> general said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>An 884-page report made public by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro after a two-year investigation contained <strong>graphic</strong> examples of children being <strong>groomed</strong> and sexually abused by <strong>clergymen</strong>. It was largely based on documents from secret <strong>archives</strong> kept by the <strong>dioceses</strong>, including handwritten confessions by priests, he said.</p>
<p>Several of the dioceses issued statement apologizing to victims and saying they were taking steps to ensure any criminal behavior was stopped.</p>
<p>As accusers wept behind him, Shapiro described <strong>alleged</strong> abuse by priests in six of the state’s eight dioceses. “The pattern was abuse, deny and cover up,” Shapiro said, adding that church officals sought to keep abuse allegations quiet long enough so they could no longer be <strong>prosecuted</strong> under Pennsylvania’s <strong>statue</strong> of limitations. Only two of the 301 priests cited by the report are still <strong>subject to</strong> prosecution. Shapiro said the grand jury identified about a thousand victims, but believed there may be many more.</p>
<p>Describing the <strong>weaponization</strong> of faith to silence victims, Shapiro said:”Children were taught that this abuse was not only normal but that it was holy”</p>
<p>Since the Boston abuse scandal <strong>erupted</strong> in the 1990s, accusations involving American <strong>clerics</strong> have <strong>sporadically</strong> surfaced. Theodore McCarrick, a former <strong>archbishop</strong> of Washington, resigned last month after accusations resurfaced that he abused a 16-year-old boy decades ago.</p>
<p>In recent months, Pope Francis accepted a number of resignations from Chilean bishops in a sex abuse scandal that has rocked that country.</p>

<p>China <strong>pledged</strong> on Monday to tighten oversight of its transport industry and warned that the country did not need ride-hailing firms which compromised on passenger safety, days after a Didi Chuxing passenger was raped and murdered by her driver.</p>
<p>The killing of a 20-year-old passenger who rode in the Didi vehicle on Friday in the eastern city of WenZhou is the second such incident since May, <strong>denting</strong> the image of the Beijing-based company, which is the world’s largest ride-hailing firm by number of rides and is expanding globally.</p>
<p>Didi declined to comment on Monday. It has <strong>suspended</strong> its <strong>Hitch carpooling</strong> service and previously said that it felt deeply responsible and would complete by Sept.1 a new <strong>compliance</strong> operation to be inspected by the ministries and the public.</p>
<p>After a 21-year-old flight attendant was murdered in May, allegedly by her Didi Hitch driver. the company took steps including limiting the hours during which carpool drivers can pick up passengers of the opposite sex, and testing an “escort mode” on its app enabling passengers to share their routes and destinations with <strong>emergency contacts</strong></p>
<p>The latest killing has been one of the most discussed topics on China’s Twitter-like Weibo service since the weekend, with Didi’s offical apology post gaining more than 500,000 comments.</p>
<p>Many Chinese <strong>netizens</strong> said that they wanted to see key changes being made and that public trust was being <strong>eroded</strong> as it was not the first incident.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Sorry to Bother You</em>, a comedy-drama starring Lakeith Stanfield, is one of the most anti-captialist movies Hollywood has ever produced. We’re used to seeing the rich protrayed as evil, but here we see people sell their souls to <strong>ascend</strong> the <strong>corporate ladder</strong>.</p>
<p>Standfield’s character, Cassius “Cash” Green, a low-level <strong>telemarketer</strong>, learns that, in order to succeed at work, he has to put on a white voice. To see a black actor adopts such giving. But on a deeper level, watching Cash learn to “sound white”, and have his career <strong>skyrocket</strong> as a result, is a superb <strong>parody</strong> of something that many black people in the corporate world have found: in order to succeed, you have to perform your personality in a way that is pleasing to white people.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the film is a <strong>devastaing takedown</strong> of capitalist, portraying people giving up their freedom so they don’t have to worry about money. Owners and management are shown as <strong>depraved</strong> evil, <strong>scheming</strong> to create workers who are ever cheaper, more <strong>compliant</strong> and more profitable.</p>
<p>This is the genius of the film: it <strong>indicts</strong> the entire system. It is critical that workers believe they have a chance to ascend, so they have a chance to ascend, so they will keep working. And it’s critical that the wealthy believe they’ll never fall off their <strong>perches</strong>, so they’ll keep taking chances, keep investing.</p>
<p>It shows us a capitalism that promises us happiness through <strong>rampant</strong> consumption. The wealthy grow wealthier, the middle class <strong>shrinks</strong> and the number of poor people <strong>swells</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Medical school costs a lot of money that a lot of people don’t have. That often means students do a bit of <strong>cost-benefit analysis</strong>: Is it worth it to take on hundreds of thousand of dollars of debt now for the possibility of making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year later?</p>
<p>New York University’s School of Medicine is trying to remove that calculation as a factor in students’ career decision making. The school announced yesterday that it will provide all new, future, and current students a full-tuition scholarship financial need and <strong>merit</strong> aside, meaning wealthy students and low income students alike will receive it. The scholarship doesn’t cover the rest of the costs associated with college–housing, food. child care–but it takes $55018 a year <strong>out of the picture</strong></p>
<p>“This decision recognizes a moral <strong>imperative</strong> that must be addressed, as institutions place an increasing debt burden on young people who aspire to become <strong>physicians</strong>.” Robert Grossman, the school’s dean, said in a statement. “A population as diverse as ours is best served by doctors from <strong>all walks of life</strong>, we believe, and <strong>aspiring</strong> physicians ans surgeons should not be prevented from pursuing a career in medicine because of the prospect of overwhelming financial debt.” The school will need to raise $600 million to fund the project–$450 million of which it says has already been raised.</p>
<p>“Tuition-free medical education goes beyound the merit and financial scholarships, and debt cancellations that other academic centers have traditonally favored,” Rafael Rivera, the <strong>associate</strong> dean for admissions and financial aid at the medical school, said in a statement. “More importantly,” he continueed, “it addresses both physician shortages and diversity”</p>

<p><strong>Celeberates</strong> and <strong>influencers</strong> who <strong>endrose</strong> products without labeling their social media posts as paid-for by brands were warned in early August that they were breaking the rules as Britain’s <strong>regulator launched an investigation into</strong> the trend.</p>
<p>Recommendation from celebrities and social media influencers who have millions of followers is a <strong>growing</strong> marketing strategy for brands, but the UK Competition and Markets Authority(CMA) said that such <strong>endorsements</strong> could <strong>mislead</strong> customers.</p>
<p>“If people see clothes, <strong>cosmetics</strong>, a car, or a holiday <strong>being plugged by someone</strong> they admire, they might <strong>be swayed into</strong> buying it,” said George Lusty, the CMA’s Senior Director for Consumer Protection.</p>
<p>“So it’s really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand.”</p>
<p>Brands will pay <strong>anywhere from</strong> $10,000 <strong>to</strong> more than $100,000 for a single social media post, depending on the size, <strong>engagement</strong> and <strong>loyalty</strong> of the person’s followers, and Unilever said it <strong>accounted for</strong> “tens of millions” of its 7.7-billion-euro marketing last year.</p>
<p>The most famous can earn even more. Reality TV stars Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian, singer Selena Gomez and Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo are the <strong>top-paid</strong> celebrities per post on Instagram, earning up to 1 million dollars a post, according to social media analytics firm HopperHQ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Students at schools, colleges and universities across Scotland will have access to free <strong>sanitary</strong> products available free to all of its 395,000 pupils and students to help “banish the <strong>scourge</strong> of period poverty” – when girls and women struggle to pay for basic sanitary products on a monthly basis, significantly affecting their <strong>hygiene</strong>, health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>A recent survey of more than 2,000 people by Young Scot found that one in four respondents at school, college or university in Scotland struggled to access sanitary products. Moreover. research by the <strong>grassroots</strong> group Women for Independence revealed nearly one in five women had experienced period poverty.</p>
<p>The Scotland government said it worked closely with partners including the Convention of Scotland Local Authorities(Cosla), Colleges Scotland, Universities Scotland and the Scottish Funding Council on the scheme.</p>
<p>The communities secretary, Aileen Campbell. said: “I am proud that Scotland is talking this world-leading action to fight period poverty and I welcome the support of local authorities, college and universities in implementing this <strong>initiative</strong>“.</p>
<p>Councillor Alison Evison, the president of Cosla, said while the primary aim of the scheme was to ensure no young person <strong>missed out on</strong> their education through a lack of access to sanitary products, “it will also contribute to a more open conversation and reducing the unnecessary <strong>stigma</strong> associated with periods.”</p>

<p>Britain’s longest <strong>heatwave</strong> since 1976 has been vanilla ice-cream sales soar, but a survey has revealed that some brands are sold without <strong>vanilla</strong>, cream or fresh milk.</p>
<p>Vanilla has traditionally been Britain’s favourate but a Which? investigation of supermarket and branded vanilla ice-creams found a number of them were lacking some key ingredients.</p>
<p>One in five of the ice-creams examined by the consumer <strong>watchdog</strong> had none of the three ingredients shoppers might reasonably expert to find in vanilla ice-cream. Only half of the 24 surveyed contained all three traditional ingredients.</p>
<p>In a number of the products Which? looked at, cream and milk were substituted dried skimmed milk, and in some cases, <strong>whey</strong> protein. Vanilla was often replaced with a general <strong>flavouring</strong>.</p>
<p>The price if vanilla soared earlier this year, making it more expensive than silver. It currently sells for around &amp;440 a kilo.</p>
<p>Vanilla has become the second most expensive spice in the world after <strong>saffron</strong>, the harvesting of which is extremely <strong>labour-intensive</strong>.</p>
<p>Vanilla beans, which are part of the <strong>orchid</strong> family, are hand <strong>pollinates</strong> on family farms. Each flower opens for only part of one day during the season, if it is not pollinated. Once picked, the curing process, which involves drying the beans in the sun by day and allowing them to <strong>sweat</strong> in a box at night, takes three to six months.</p>
<p>Vanilla is grown in tropical regions. More than 75% is produced in Madagascar, an island off the south-eastern coast of Africa. The region was struck by a powerful <strong>cyclone</strong> last month that damaged many <strong>plantations</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was the 1970s. President Richard Nixon had been undone by a pair of young reporters at the <em>The Washington Post</em>, Hollywood had made a <strong>blockbuster</strong> movie about it, and the reporters had become celebrities. People were excited about <strong>journalism</strong>–and that was reflected in massive enrollment jumps at journalism schools across the country. In 1970, enrollment of jouralism majors <strong>hovered</strong> at about 33,000; by 1979, that figure had jumped to 71,000.</p>
<p><strong>Fast-forward</strong> nearly half a century and the attacks being made on journalism are too lengthy to list, but they flow from the top. President Donald Trump doesn’t keep a list of reporters he finds to be enemies so much as he tries to publicly shame, <strong>vilify</strong>, and <strong>discredit</strong> them on social media and in speeches. He has called journalists everything from <strong>the enemy of the people</strong> to <strong>very dangerous &amp; sick</strong> and repeatedly <strong>decried</strong> the media as “fake news”. But just like during the 60s and 70s, there’s a <strong>whiplash</strong> news cycle. And across the country. students have renewed interest in journalism.</p>
<p>In an era where truth has actively been questioned by an administration that has consistently lied, the school–and others like it–have <strong>doubled down</strong> on teaching media literacy, fact-checking, and the basic <strong>tenets</strong> of reporting. “We are reemphasizing truth and accuracy,” Gail Wiggins, the <strong>interim</strong> chair of the journalism department at North Carolina A&amp;T University, said. “With all of the new digital tools that we have at our hands–being accurate, checking your sources, doing your research: We definitely talk more about [those values] now than ever before”.</p>

Or is it merely a black circular painting? Perhaps you could call it a <strong>meditation</strong> on the <strong>sublime</strong>. Or an accident waiting to happen.</p>
<p>The artwork was first seen in 1992, but the inevitable accident has finally come. A visitor to Kapoor’s show at the Serralves Museum in Porto, Portugal, had to be taken to hosptial after ending up inside what is in fact a 2.5-metre-deep hole.</p>
<p><em>Descent into Limbo</em> is one of those modern artworks that seen to menace life and limb. When Doris Salcedo cut a <strong>crack</strong> through the floor of Tate Modern’s <strong>Turbine</strong> Hall in London in 2007, visitors could not resist putting a foot or a leg inside. Quite a few injures resulted from playful <strong>antics</strong>.</p>
<p>We want art to be dangerous, but not that dangerous. Or do we? It has been recognised since the Romantic age that some of the most powerful imaginative experiences <strong>derive from</strong> terror, horror and awe.

He observed that real, even life-threatening, danger will always <strong>trump</strong> mere pictures of horror. Today, artists <strong>teeter</strong> over that <strong>percipice</strong>. <strong>installation art</strong> can put us at real risk, as if we were climbing a mountain or exploring a cave.</p>
<p>Luckily, the victim of Kapoor’s Black hole is said to be doing well in hospital. Most injuries caused by art are, <strong>mercifully</strong>, <strong>mild</strong>.

<blockquote>
<p>Alcohol is physically bad for you in any quantity; and the more you drink, the worse its health effects. The <strong>gigantic</strong> report on the subject published last week is <strong>unequivocal</strong> and <strong>authoritative</strong>. The report was based on enormous amounts of data: 28 million people around the world were examined in 592 studies to estimate the health risks.</p>
<p>The variety of ways in which alcohol can kill or damage people <strong>comes as</strong> a <strong>shock</strong>. It is the trade-off between cancer and heart disease which leads the researchers to reject the notion that <strong>morderate</strong> drinking has health benefits compared with <strong>abstinence</strong>: they find that the increased risk of cancers <strong>outweighs</strong> the <strong>diminished</strong> risk of heart disease among middle-aged moderate drinkers.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most <strong>startling</strong> single finding is that two-thirds of the world’s population don’t drink at all. They manage without a drug apparently essential to <strong>civilised</strong> life in the west. The question is whether those of us in the other third should try to <strong>emulate</strong> them.</p>
<p>Alcohol is bad for judgment and can promote a <strong>destructive solipsim</strong>. But it can also stimulate imagination, courage and friendship in a way that is hard to achieve otherwise. There is a reason why wine is tightly linked to paradise in religious poerty. A world without drink might find itself poorer as well as richer.</p>
<p>The report is right that many people should drink less than they do. Perhaps the real benefit of moderate drinking is not that it requires a little <strong>self-discipline</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>France’s beloved bread loaf, the <strong>baguette</strong>, may be about to lose some of its bite, with politicians looking into the health risks of <strong>additives</strong> set to propose legislation forcing bakers and processed food makers more generally to <strong>slash</strong> salt content.</p>
<p>After months of investigation and hearings, a <strong>parliamentary</strong> committee has come to the conclusion that voluntary agreements on the reduction of high solt levels have not been respected and that it is time to impose healthier <strong>norms</strong> via legislation.</p>
<p>“It’s a real public health problem,” said Loic Prud’homme, one of a 20-member parliamentary committee looking into the matter. Michele Crouzet, another committee member, said the daily intake of salt in France, at about 10 to 12 grams, is still double the limit recommended by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Excessive salt levels are linked to <strong>cardiovascular</strong> trouble, which in France is the second-bigger killer among health problems.</p>
<p>Crouzet said the committee could propose a tax on salt like one already intruduced in France on the sugar content of <strong>fizzy</strong> drinks. But some say that <strong>levy</strong> has been ineffective because manufactures are shifting to other forms of <strong>sweetener</strong>.</p>
<p>“What we can now say is that voluntary agreements do not work and it’s now time to switch to <strong>bindin</strong> constraints,” Prud’homme told Reuters.</p>
<p>In the case of the baguette, and bread more generally, voluntary agreements struck in 2002 had sought to limit the salt level to 18 grams per kilo of flour within five years, he said. Some 16 years later, that goal had still not been met.</p>

<p>A regional coouncil in New Zealand has proposed banning all domestic cats <strong>in an attempt</strong> to protect native animals.</p>
<p>Environment Southland’s “pest plan” calls for all domestic cats in the region to be <strong>neutered microchipped</strong> and registered. Then, when a cat dies, residents would not be permitted to have another.</p>
<p>Ali Meade, the council’s <strong>biosecurity</strong> operations manager, said that if the move was approved the improvement for the improvement for the environment and bird life would be vast.</p>
<p>Omaui resident Nico Jarvis told the <em>Otago Daily Times</em> that she was shocked and planned a petition against the plan. She said that her three cats were the only way to combat a rodent problem in the area. “If I cannot have a cat, it almost becomes unhealthy for me to live in my house,” she said.</p>
<p>Jarvis likened the plan to living in a “police state..” It’s not even regulating people’s ability to have a cat. It’s saying you can’t have a cat.</p>
<p>The move comes as New Zealand works on an ambitious goal to become <strong>predator-free</strong> by 2050. That plan is devoted to wiping out introduced species of rats, stoats and <strong>possums</strong>.</p>

<p>Before the concept of countries existed, Luzia walked the broad <strong>savanna</strong> of what is now south-central Brazil. Her remains were buried in the Vermelha Cave about 11,500 years ago until they were found and studied in the 20th century. Researchers later said her existence challenged the basic understanding of how humans migrated, and when.</p>
<p>Luzia’s remains are among nearly 20 million items feared <strong>incinerated</strong> after a <strong>blaze roared</strong> through Rio de Janeiro’s National Museum on Sunday, in an <strong>inferno</strong> that Brazilian offcials and scientists are describing as an unbearable <strong>erasure</strong> of human history potentially caused by years of neglect.</p>
<p>The fire was like “a <strong>lobotomy</strong> of the Brazilian memory,” said Marina Silva, a former encironment minister and candidate in the upcoming presidential election, according to the Guardian. Vedio of the blaze showed twin <strong>columns</strong> of <strong>towering</strong> fire reaching against black sky.</p>
<p>President Michel Temer said Monday the loss was “<strong>incalculable</strong>“ to Brazil.</p>

BBC reporter Katy Wilson said “thousands” at the scene blamed the fire on years of <strong>austerity</strong> measures for lack of funding and modernization efforts at museum.</p>
<p>Brazil has struggled to emerge from a 2014 recession and the political fallout that followed, and the museum blaze threatens to become a symbol for angry Brazilians frustrated by high unemployment and <strong>glacial</strong> economic growth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft has announced a policy requiring its <strong>contractors</strong> to offer employees a minimum of a 12 weeks <strong>paid parental leave</strong>, paying them up to $1,000 a week.</p>
<p>The policy, which affects US-based companies that do work for the technology company and have more than 50 employees, will be <strong>rolled out</strong> over the next year. It will affect people including the company’s cateteria workers, <strong>janitors</strong>, IT supports staff and engineering consultants.</p>
<p>Microsoft was <strong>prompted</strong> to introduce the policy after Washington state, where the company is <strong>headquartered</strong>, passed legislation requring companies to offer employees and contractors paid parental leave. The company said it wanted to give the same benefit offered by the legislation, which comes into effect in 2020, to contracted staff across the US. The company noted that the policy could increase its costs.</p>
<p>The policy will bring the parental leave benefits of affected contractors <strong>in line with</strong> those of full-time employees, who also get 12 weeks parental leave, while birth mothers get an additional eight weeks off.</p>
<p>“The case of paid parental leave is clear,” said the commpany’s general <strong>counsel</strong>, Dev Stahlkopf, in a blogpost, citing various studies showing that it improves productivity, <strong>morale</strong> and <strong>retention</strong> of new mothers.</p>
<p>“Further, when men and women have the opportunity to take paid leave, it can help <strong>counteract</strong> gender caregiving stereotypes, <strong>neutralize</strong> stigmas and promote equity in the home and office”, added Stahlkopf.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been under pressure to improve working conditions for contractors after some workers <strong>unionized</strong> in 2014 and started pushing for benefits like paid leave. In 2015, Microsoft announced it would require its suppliers to give their workers at least 15 days paid time off.</p>

<p>“A woman must <strong>continually</strong> watch herself,” is a John Berger quote you might remember if you studied art at school. The theory goes, “how she appears to men is <strong>of crucial importance</strong> for what is normally <strong>thought of as</strong> the success of the life.”</p>
<p>The quote works well as an answer to the question asked by a new academic study, “Why are there so many sexy selfies of women everywhere these days?”</p>
<p>For Dr Khandis Blake of the University of New South Wales, the reason goes like this: “These behaviours are completely <strong>rational</strong>, even <strong>adaptive</strong> … When a young woman adjusts her bikini <strong>provocatively</strong> with her phone <strong>at the ready</strong> .. think of her as a <strong>strategic</strong> player in a complex social and evolutionary game.”</p>
<p>Female flesh is <strong>offered up</strong> to be looked at. Offering it up to be looked at can bring rewards for the women who take part. Apparently it’s not about the power of the straight male <strong>gaze</strong>, or <strong>patriarchal</strong> pressure. It’s about economics.</p>
<p>In analysing 68,562 selfies on Instagram and Facebook tagged with words like “sexy” and “hot” from 113 countries across the world, Blake’s study concluded that women are more likely to post sexy selfies of place where “economic inequality is rising, and not in places where men hold more societal power.”</p>
<p>Women who use this strategy to gain influence and money shouldn’t <strong>be shamed for narcissism</strong> considered stupid, or <strong>pitied</strong> – we’re all operating in a system that offers certain options to us, and working to gain reward.</p>

<p>Forty French fishing boats attack five British boats in the Channel. Stones and somke bombs are thrown. Rude words are exchanged in two languages. The British retreat.</p>
<p>Similar incidents have been happening for 15 years - or arguably for the last 900 years. The <strong>rights and wrongs</strong> are complicated. Yesterday evening the French boats were undoubledly the <strong>aggressors</strong>. They <strong>put to sea</strong> not in order to fish, but to <strong>harass</strong> the English and Scottish boats that had entered “their waters”.</p>
<p>It was <strong>foolhardy</strong> of the French fishermen, but <strong>exasperated</strong>. The latest outbreak of the Baie de la Seine <strong>scallop</strong> war should be seen in the context of Brexit and the deep uncertainties and exaggerated exceptations encouraged by simplistic and vaugue UK plans to reclaim “our seas” and “our fish”.</p>
<p>Ironies abound. In this dispute, British boats are asserting their right to fish in French waters ever when they are closed to French <strong>trawlers</strong>. This right depends on EU rules, but <strong>pre-dates</strong> the EU fishing policy.</p>
<p>In truth, the Seine Bay war is a <strong>storm warning</strong>. It shows what may happen on a wider scale if a hard Brexit removes all common rules for management of fisheries in European seas. It is also a uesful reminder that some Brirish boats rely on European rules for access to their prey – and the European single market to sell their produce.</p>
<p>Above all, as one leading British voice pointed out:”It shows how complicated fisheries policy is. We have access to those waters becaues of historic rights that go back well before the common fisheries policy. The same applies to French and other fishermen in our waters. Those rights will not disappear with Brexit, whatever some politicians and fishermen’s leaders may say.”</p>

<p>Jack Ma, the <strong>charismatic</strong> co-founder of China’s largest e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, will <strong>step down</strong> as chairman in exactly one year on Sept.10, 2019, the company said.

<p>Ma, who co-founded Alibaba in 1999, is one of China’s richest people with a <strong>net worth</strong> of $36.6 billion, according to <em>Forbes</em>.

<p>Ma, who also controls Alibaba payment <strong>affiliate</strong> Ant Financial [ANTFIN.UL], is <strong>stepping back amid</strong> more challenging times for Chinese tech companies as sales growth in China’s eastern <strong>mega-cities</strong> shows signs of slowing.</p>
<p>Alibaba maintained <strong>robust revenue</strong> growth in the first half of 2018, but its <strong>profit margins</strong> have been <strong>squeezed</strong> by <strong>big-ticket</strong> investments as it <strong>battles</strong> to maintain <strong>pole position</strong> in payments and e-commerce.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>India’s top court overturned a 157-year old law criminalizing gay sex in a <strong>landmark</strong> victory for gay rights.</p>
<p>A <strong>panel</strong> of five judges issued a <strong>unanimous</strong> judgment <strong>striking down</strong> the <strong>provision</strong> and affirming the right to equality and dignity.</p>
<p>“Respect for individual choice is the essence of liberty,” Dipak Misra, India’s chief justice, told a <strong>packed</strong> courtroom. “This freedom can only be fulfilled when each of us realizes that the LGBT community possesses equal rights.”</p>
<p>The ruling sparked <strong>jubilation</strong> among members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer(LGBTQ) community. News channels showed people in cities across India weeping and embracing as they celebrated the historic decision.</p>
<p>The judgment reflects rapid social change in India, where only five years ago, the top court <strong>unheld</strong> the same law. Since then, campaigners have <strong>mobilized</strong> a movement to spread awareness about gay rights. In recent years, more than 30 Indian cities have held their first gay pride parades, and public protests against the provision have spread across the country.</p>
<p>Economic and technological changes have <strong>spurred</strong> shifts in thinking, too – cheap smartphones and mobile data opened young Indians to global trends and dating apps, while the <strong>mushrooming</strong> of India’s information technology <strong>sector</strong> has created a richer – and freer – generation of urban youth.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court decision is expected to be celebrated across India throughout the day and into the night. Activists <strong>pledged</strong> that the ruling was just the begining. They vowed to continue to seek legal protecting from violence and abuse and seek the right to marry and adopt children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While training for a <strong>half-marathon</strong> last fall, Janet Sherman, 57, started noticing pain in her right leg and left foot. A diagnosis of a <strong>quadriceps strain</strong> and plantar fasciitis led to shoe inserts and <strong>cross-training</strong>. Before long, the Wyoming-based teacher was “just good enough” to get back to training, and so she did, although she <strong>opted to</strong> drop down to a shorter 10K race distance.</p>
<p>On race day, Sherman’s foot began bothering her early, and by a water stop two-thirds of the way throught the course, she knew she should drop out. “It was so painful, but I was stubborn and finished out the race,” she said. “Afterward, I could barely walk.”</p>
<p>The the inactive, Sherman’s attitude might be hard to understand. But for a <strong>amateur</strong> athletes and <strong>weekend warriors</strong>, pushing through pain is common <strong>refrain</strong>. “As a society, we are more active in sports than ever before,” said Adrienne Langelier, a Texas-based sports psychology consultant. “But at the same time, as a culture we have developed a ‘no days off’ <strong>mentality</strong>.”</p>
<p>That needs to change, said Mark Cucuzzella, a physician and a professor at the West Virginia University School of Medicine. ‘No pain, no gain’ - no, thank you, he <strong>quipped</strong>. “For too long, we have <strong>glamorized</strong> that way of thinking. It’s not sustainable.”</p>
<p>Pressing too hard can lead to injury, illness and exhaustion. With running, for instance, pushing through pain can lead to a secondary injury, said Adam Tenforde of the Spaulding National Running Center at Harvard Medical School. “A stress <strong>fracture</strong>, if you continue to run on it, may progress to a full fracture and require a much longer recoveru period, for example,” he said. “I advocate for addressing pain early, rather than ignoring it.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Giulia Mensiteri, an <strong>alumnus</strong> of one of France’s elite universities, takes little no personal interest in clothes. So it is likely to have been an ugly surprise to the French fashion industry that her PhD – now <strong>a book entitled</strong> <em>The Most Beautiful Job in the World</em> – has <strong>opened up</strong> its <strong>secretive</strong> profession in such a dramatically public way.</p>
<p>The reality of fashion was illustrated by Mesitieri’s chance introduction to her <strong>subject matter</strong>. She met “Mia”, a successful Italian <strong>stylist</strong> who had moved to Paris: “She was wearing Chanel shoes and being flown across the world in <strong>business class</strong>.” But Mia couldn’t <strong>afford to</strong> rent a room, so she was <strong>couch surfing</strong> at a friend’s house. “She was eating McDonald’s every day. She never knew when she would be paid for a job and how much she would get. For a week’s work, a very big luxury brand gave her a <strong>voucher</strong> for &amp;4,500 to spend in their <strong>boutique</strong>.”</p>
<p>True, Mia could have sold it. But Mensitieri points out that working in fashion means being seen in a constantly updated uniform of beautiful, expensive clothes and <strong>accessories</strong> – paid for by vouchers instead of a salary.</p>
<p>“The message is, you don’t have to be paid becauuse you are lucky to be there at all. Working in fashion is <strong>hyper</strong> socially <strong>validating</strong>, even if you’re unpaid. Fashion presents itself as something <strong>exceptional</strong>, a world outside the <strong>ordinary</strong>“, she says.</p>
<p>“To me, fashion is the very centre of <strong>contemporary</strong> capitalism – it <strong>upholds</strong> the old forms of <strong>exploitation</strong> and the new, very modern forms which are more a kind of self-exploitation, a <strong>blurring of the line between</strong> your work and everything you are outside of work.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Public figures including politicians, authors and actors are <strong>appealing for</strong> change in the way the country talks about suicide.</p>
<p>Author Ian Rankin, London mayor Sadiq Khan, brodacasteer Stephen Fry and DJ Lauren Laverne are among 130 <strong>signatories</strong> to a letter calling on the way in transforming how suicide is coverd.</p>
<p>The letter, which has been <strong>backed</strong> by <strong>cross-party</strong> MPs and mental health organisations <strong>Samaritans</strong> and Mind, states there should be an end to the use of the phrase “commit suicide”, which suggests suicide is a crime and suicidal thoughts are a sin, even though it has not been a crime in the UK since 1961.</p>
<p>The outdated form of words can imply suicide is a “selfish, cowardly, criminal or irreligious act rather than the <strong>manifestation</strong> of extreme <strong>mental distress</strong> and unbearable pain,” the letter states, and proposes the alternative description “died by suicide”.</p>
<p>The letter says: “We should not describe a suicide as ‘easy’, ‘painless’, ‘quick’ or ‘effective’ and we should remember to look at the long-term conequences of failed suicide attempts, not forgetting the significant life-long pain for those left behind when someone does take their own life.”</p>
<p>It adds that reports of celebrity deaths carry greater risk of encouraging others due to over-identification by volnerable people. Citing the suicide of US actor Robin Williams, it said a recent study identified a 10% increase in people killing themeslves after his death. “This we all have when it comes to talking about suicide,” it said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Hey Jude</em>, which turns 50 on 30 August, is the Beatles song most likely to be <strong>bellowd</strong> by a <strong>choir</strong> of thousands.</p>
<p>Any decent song needs to be singable, but <em>Hey Jude</em> goes further: it’s yellable and flexible. Into the gap after “Nana, na, na, nahh-na-na, nahhh”, you can <strong>slot</strong> almost any pair of <strong>syllables</strong>.</p>
<p>It is a <strong>crowd-pleaser</strong>. This month, <em>Hey Jude</em> was the No.1 Beatles song on Apple Music; On Spotify, it was No 4. So, of all the countless classics the Beatles recorded, <em>Hey Jude</em> is one of the four that younger music lovers most want to hear. What is its secret?</p>
<p>Written by McCartney, <em>Hey Jude</em> <strong>bear* his </strong>signature<strong> touch: </strong>empathy<strong> set to elegance. As McCartney melodies go, it’s direct, </strong>slamming<strong> stright into its title, just like <em>She Loves You</em>. The tune and the </strong>germ<strong> of the lyrics came to McCartney in 1968, when he was driving from London to Surrey to see Julian Lennon after John had left him for Yoko Ono. <em>Hey Jude</em> began as <em>Hey Judes</em>, an arm round the shoulder of a five-year-old, so the </strong>compassion** was there all along.</p>
<p>By then, Lennon and McCartney were writing separately, but still acting as each other’s <strong>sounding board</strong>. After working on <em>Hey Jude</em> some more, McCartney invited Lennon to his house and played it to him. One line, “The movement you need is on your shoulder”, was there as a placeholder. McCartney thought believed “that’s the best line in it”.</p>
<p>This <strong>exchange, recounted</strong> by McCartney in 1994, had two consequences, beyond preserving the line. “You love it twice as much,” he said, it would forever remind him of Lennon: “It’s an emotional point in the song.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an interview with GQ Magazine, Prince Charles, the 69-year-old heir to the British throne, said he’s deeply <strong>dismayed</strong> by the way artificial intalligence is beginning to change the way people interact with machines.</p>
<p>“The thing I find hardest now is to cope with this extraordinary trend that somehow we must become part human, part machine, which I totally and utterly <strong>object to</strong>,” the Prince of Wales told the magazine. “It is crazy to go that far because I think, ironically, the more AI and robotics they want to introduce, the more people will rediscover the importance of the traditional <strong>crafts</strong>, the directly human things that are crafted by humans and not by machines.”</p>
<p>Charles was speaking to GQ magazine after the publication awarded him a lifetime achievement award for services to philanthropy. Long considered an environmentalist, Charles has been promoting organic farming since the 1980s and has <strong>made a point of</strong> “urging action on global warming” since at least 1990, according to Time.</p>
<p>In his interview with GQ, his skepticism of AI appears to be less about fears of a <strong>dystopian</strong> future and more about reinforcing his values surrounding environmental <strong>stewardship</strong>.</p>
<p>Charles said he has “always believed that living on a <strong>finite</strong> planet means we have to recognize that this puts certain constraints and limits on our human ambition in order to maintain the <strong>viability</strong> of the planet.”</p>
<p>“That is why it matters so much that the way we operate has to <strong>be in tune with</strong> the way nature and the universe works and not the way we think it ought to work, which is what we have been doing,” he added.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a society, we barely discuss the realities and <strong>implications</strong> of singledom. In pop culture singledom is almost <strong>invariably</strong> represented as an easily fixed unhappy state, a step along the way to <strong>getting</strong> happily <strong>hitched</strong>. We know little about the long-term singles: how many <strong>relish</strong> their freedom and independence, and how many feel burdened with loneliness and hope to meet the love of their life? </p>
<p>The single stereotypes <strong>abound</strong>. For men, it’s the <strong>dysfunctional fortysomething</strong> still living with his parents. For women, the <strong>callous</strong> career woman – who could forget former Austratian prime minister Julia Gillard being accused of being “<strong>deliberately barren</strong>“?</p>
<p>Beyond the stereotypes, there’s been remarkably little <strong>robust</strong> research on singledom and social <strong>infertility</strong>. Love, family and relationships only <strong>feature in</strong> policy debates about how we live to the extent that they concern children’s lives. Our attitude has always been that – outside medical infertility – finding love and family life in the first place is an entirely private matter.</p>
<p>But social infertility exists, and we should be talking about it more, from whether there should be publicly funded <strong>fertility</strong> advice for women looking to <strong>conceive</strong> alone, to the realities of ageing  without children, to whether we should be investing in research into how to extend women’s fertility spans in the first place.</p>
<p>To do so, though, we need to be able to have healthy conversations about singledom that go beyond the painful, shaming stereotypes of the undatebale, the unloveable and the “deliverately barren”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sweden faces a <strong>protracted</strong> period of political uncertainty after an election that left the two main <strong>parliamentary</strong> blocs tied but well short of a majority, and the far-right Sweden Demorcrats promising to <strong>wield</strong> “real influcence” in parliament despite making more modest gains than many had predicted.</p>
<p>The <strong>populist</strong>, anti-immigrant party won 17.6% of the vote, according to <strong>perliminary</strong> offical results – well up on the 12.9% it scored in 2014, but far below the 25%-plus some polls had predicted earlier in the summer. It looked highly likely, however, to play a significant role as kingmaker.</p>
<p>The election was Sweden’s first since the government allowed 163,000 migrants into the country–the most <strong>per capita</strong> of any European nation – during Europe’s 2015 migration crisis, polarising the nation’s 7.3 million voters and <strong>magnifying</strong> popular concern about a welfare system many felt was already under strain.</p>
<p>Far-right parties have made significant gains <strong>at the expense of</strong> the political mainstream across western Europe in recent years in the <strong>aftermath</strong> of the 2008 global financal crisis, and the 2015 refugee crisis, and are now in government in Italy, Austria, Norway and Finland.</p>
<p>“Traditional parties have failed to respond to the sense of <strong>discontent</strong> that exists,” said Magnus Blomgren of Umea University. “That descontent maybe isn’t directly related to unemployment or the economy, but simply a loss of faith in the political system. Sweden isn’t alone in this.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term “anti-ageing” may now be taboo, but the new era of beauty advertising still profits on women’s insecurities.</p>
<p>It is no longer fashionable to be anto-ageing it has been <strong>rebadged</strong> as “pro-skin”, by the founder of American skincare brand Drunk Elephant and “anti-wrinkles” by Neutrogena. A new vocabulary now dominates the languate of the beauty industry, the <strong>ethos</strong> of body-positivity finally <strong>inching</strong> its way up to the top.</p>
<p>It falls into a familiar category: stuff you know is basically <strong>tripe</strong>, but you can’t really <strong>object to</strong> because what went before it was worse. Still, the principe is that any visible sign of ageing is a disgusting thing in a woman, whether that is wrinkle or the <strong>overall dulling</strong> effect of having seen too much life.</p>
<p>Is it in any way <strong>preferable</strong> for the term “anti-ageing” to become taboo while all its <strong>apparatus</strong> remains <strong>intact</strong>? Take the Neutrogena products that dare not say “anti-ageing”  still say “anti-wrinkles”. Or does it just <strong>resituate</strong> the <strong>discomfort</strong> back with the consumer?</p>
<p>If fear of <strong>mortality</strong> is universal, then attempting to erase its reminders is reasonable. It is not a feminist’s duty to look like a teatowel that got stuck at the back of a <strong>tumble</strong> dryer. It is where <strong>vanity</strong> is <strong>marshalled</strong> by commerce that it becomes <strong>oppressive</strong> and <strong>disproportionable</strong>. Anti-ageing is an OK word and an OK pursuit, so long as you don’t <strong>buy into</strong> products at all; make face masks out of white wine and bathe in the <strong>excretions</strong> of a donkey, like <strong>Cleopatra</strong>, who was oppressed by nobody.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meituan Dianping, which raised $4.2 billion in its Hong Kong IPO, is one of China’s super-apps, with 340 million users ordering groceries, paying bills, renting bikes and booking hotels – but it is far from alone.</p>
<p>The delivery-to-ticketing platform, backed by internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, is <strong>squaring off</strong> with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd-backed rivals including Alipay, Ele.me and Koubei as well as Tencent’s own WeChat.</p>
<p>MeiTuan Dianping, like many of China’s fast-growing tech firms, has had to burn cash to <strong>keep ahead of</strong> rivals, both to <strong>subsidize</strong> shoppers and add new services. It bought bike-sharing firm Mobike for $2.7 billion this year, an expensive acquistion that is <strong>straining its margins</strong>.</p>
<p>But it sees room for growth, Citing a report from iResearch, it estimates China’s consumer service e-commerce market will grow to 8.01 trillion yuan($1.7 trillion) by 2023, almost three times the size of the market last year.</p>
<p>“In the short term there will be <strong>turbulence</strong>, but in the long run I expect(Meituan’s) valuation to exceed $100 billion,” said Li Chengdong, a Beijing-based tech analyst. “The reasoning is simple: the position that Meituan has in food and amusement services is similar to Alibaba in e-commerce, but even more solid,” Li added, “The market is big enough.”</p>
<p>The battle for that market is <strong>playing out</strong> on China’s streets, with Meituan’s <strong>fleet</strong> of yellow-and-black-clad <strong>couriers</strong> competing against an army of blue-wearing Ele.me workers and red-uniformed Baidu takeaway crew.</p>
<p>“The question will be, when you stop subsidizing the items, how many people can afford it?” Jane Sun, chief executive of CHinese online travel platform Ctrip, told Reuters in an interview in Beijing. Company who is using cash <strong>rebates</strong> to gain customers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Want to figure out if someone is a <strong>psychopath</strong>? Ask them what their favourite song is. A New York University study last year found that people who loved Eminem’s <em>Lost Yourself</em> and Justin Bieber’s <em>What Do You Mean?</em> were more likely to score highly on the psychopathy <strong>scale</strong><br> than people who were into Dire Straits.</p>
<p>Over the past few years. Spotify has been <strong>ramping up</strong> its data analytic capabilities in a bid to help marketers target consumers with adverts <strong>tailored</strong> to the mood they’re in. They deduce this from the sort of music you’re listening to, coupled with where and when you’re listening to it, along with third-party data that might be available.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, there’s nothing particulary <strong>machiavellian</strong> about what Spotify is doing with your data. I certainly don’t think that they are working with <strong>shadowy consulting firms</strong> to serve you ads promoting a culture war while you’re listening to music that suggests you might in a casually recist mood. Nevertheless, I find it depressing that our personal, privata moments with music are increasing being turned into data points and sold to advertisers.</p>
<p>You can see where this could go, can’t you? As ad targeting gets ever more sophisticated, marketers will have the ability to target our emotions in potentially <strong>exploitative</strong> ways. According to one study, tutked <strong>Misery</strong> Is Not Miserly, you are more likely to spend more on a product if you’re feeling sad. You can imagine some companies might take advantage of that. And <strong>on that note</strong>, I’m feeling a little down about all this. <strong>Heading off</strong> to <strong>treat myself to</strong> something expensive.</p>

<p>Never mind the protests from health and safety. A research paper that describes how employees can overcome workplace injustice by torturing a voodoo doll that resembles their boss has <strong>landed</strong> one of the most <strong>coveted</strong> awards in <strong>academia</strong>: an Ig Nobel prize.</p>
<p>The study, which sought to understand why <strong>disgruntled</strong> staff <strong>retaliate against</strong> bad <strong>superiors</strong>, found that <strong>tormenting</strong> a doll with pins and other <strong>implements</strong> helped restore their sense of fairness in the world.</p>
<p>The Ig Nobel awards celebrate work that “first makes them laugh, and then makes them think”. Ten awards were announced on Thursday night at a ceremony at Harvard. They included a nutrition prize for work that revealed the unimpressice nutrirtional value of a <strong>cannibalistic</strong> diet. Lindie Liang and fellow psychologists at the University of Waterloo in Ontario won the economics prize for the voodoo doll <strong>investigation</strong>.</p>
<p>In a series of experiments reported in the <em>Leadership Quarterly</em>, workers wrer asked to recall a time when their boss abused or bullied them, then half were given the chance to unleash their frustration on a virtual voodoo doll. “Those who <strong>stabbed</strong> the doll representing their boss felt a greater sense of fairness and justice,” said Douglas Brown, a member of the team.</p>
<p>Brown concedes that employees may want to find more positive ways to vent their anger after being offended by a bad boss, but he does not <strong>dismiss</strong> the value of virtual <strong>vengeance</strong>. “I personally don’t see any harm in torturing a voodoo doll, if it makes you feel better,” he said. “We get to show people that science doesn’t necessarily need to be dry and boring. Sometimes you can do sound science and have a laugh along the way.”</p>

<p>The next battle in the streaming TV wars will unfold on Monday’s Emmys stage, where Netflixs Inc aims to end HBO’s 16-year <strong>streak</strong> as the night’s biggest winner and earn <strong>bragging rights</strong> for its marketing.</p>
<p>For the first time, Netflix will head to the ceremony with more nominations than any other network, with 112. AT&amp;T-owned HBO, however, will bring its <strong>formidable</strong> “Game of Thrones,” which scored 22 of the <strong>premium</strong> cable network’s 108 nods.</p>
<p>HBO and Netflix have fought for viewers since 2013 when the streaming service launched “House of Cards,” a political thriller that established it as a home for top-quality TV programming. HBO had long dominated that space with <strong>acclaimed</strong> series such as “The Sopranos” and “Sex and the City”.</p>
<p>Netflix has since expanded into a wide range of genres, which helped boost its nominations count with shows such as reality series “Queer Eye.”</p>
<p>HBO has argued that its focus on a smaller, <strong>curated slate</strong> of programming ensures quality.</p>
<p>Randall Stephenson, chairman and chiefexecutive of HBO owner AT&amp;T Inc, on Wednesday call Netflix the WalMart of video subscription services, while he likened HBO to luxury jeweler Tiffany &amp; Co.</p>
<p>So far, the eace is <strong>neck and neck</strong> after dozens of this year’s Emmys were handed out at events in Los Angeles earlier this month. HBO won 17 trophies, including best documentary for “The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling.” Netflix collected 16.</p>
<p>The major awards will be unveiled in a nationally televised show on Monday. IndieWire executive editor Michael Schneider predictsEnny voters will spread the awards aming several streaming services and traditional networks, but that HBO will continue to <strong>reign</strong> as the most-honored outlet overall. “HBO has more <strong>front runners</strong>“, he said.</p>

<p>The Internet has transformed the way people work and communicate. It has <strong>upended</strong> industries, from entertainment to retailing. But its most profound effect may well be on the biggest decision that most people make – choosing a mate.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s the notion of meeting a partner online seemed freakish, and <strong>not a little</strong> pathetic. Today, in many places, it is normal. Smartphones have put virtual bars in people’s pocket, where <strong>singletons</strong> can <strong>mingle free from</strong> the constraints of social or physical geography. Globally, at least 200m people use digitial dating services every month. In America more than a third of marriages now start with an online match-up. The Internet is the second-most-popular way for Americans to meet people of the opposites sex, and is fast catching up with real-world “friend of a friend” introductions.</p>
<p>Digital dating is a massive social experiment, conducted on one of humanity’s most <strong>intimate</strong> and vital processes. Its effects are only just starting to become visile.</p>
<p>Meeting a mate over the Internet is fundamentally different from meeting one offline. In the physical world meeting a friend of a friend is<strong>the norm</strong>. People who meet online are <strong>overwhelmingly</strong> likely to be strangers. As a result, dating digitally offers much greater choice. A bar, <strong>choir</strong> or office might have a few tens of potential partners for any one person. Online there are tens of thousands.</p>
<p>This greater choice makes the digital dating market for more efficient than the offline kind. For some, that is a bad news.</p>
<p>Because of the <strong>gulf</strong> in <strong>pickness</strong> between the sexes, a few straight men <strong>are doomed</strong> never <strong>to</strong> get any mathches at all. On Tantan, a Chinese app, men express interest in 60% of of women they see, but women are interested in just 6% of men; this dynamic means that 5% of men never receive  match.</p>
<p>For most people, however, digital dating offers better outcomes. Research has found that marriages in America between people who meet online are likely to last longer; such couples profess to be happier than those who met offline. The <strong>whiff</strong> of moral panic surrounding dating apps is vastly <strong>overblown</strong>. Precious little evidence exists to show that opportunities online are encouraging <strong>infidelity</strong>.</p>
<p>Online dating is a particular <strong>boon</strong> for those with very particular requirements. Jdata allows daters to <strong>filter out</strong> matches who would not consider <strong>converting to</strong> Judaism, for instance. A vastly bigger market has had dramatic results for same-sex daters in particular. In America, 70% of gay people meet their partners online.</p>
<p>There are problems with the modern way of love, however. Many users complain of stress when confronted with the brutal realities of the difital meat market, and their place within it. Negative emotions about body image existed before the internet, but they amplified when strangers can <strong>issue snap</strong> judgements on attractiveness. The same problems that <strong>afflict</strong> other digital platforms <strong>recur</strong> in this realm, from <strong>scams</strong> to fake accounts: 10% of all newly created dating profiles do not belong to real people.</p>
<p>This new world of romance may also have unintended consequences for society.</p>
<p>The fact that online daters have so much more choice can <strong>break down</strong> barriersL evidence suggests that the internet is boosting <strong>interracial</strong> marriages by <strong>bypassing homogenous</strong> social groups. But daters are also more able to choose partners like themselves. <strong>Assortative</strong> mating already <strong>shoulders</strong> some of the blame for income inequality. Online dating may make the effect more <strong>pronounced</strong>: education levels are displayed <strong>prominently</strong> on dating profiles in a way they would never be online.</p>
<p>The domination of online dating by a handful of firms ad their <strong>algorithms</strong> is another source of worry. The entry into the market of Facebook, armed with data from its 2.2bn users, will provide clues as to whether online dating will <strong>inexorably consolidate</strong> into fewer, larger platforms.</p>
<p>But even if the market does not become ever more concentrated, the pricess of coupling(or not) has <strong>unquestionably</strong> become more centralised. Romance used to be a distributed activity which took place in a <strong>profusion</strong> of bars, clubs, churched and offices; now enormous numbers of people rely on a few companies to meet their mate. That hands a small number of coders <strong>tremendous</strong> power to engineer mating outcomes. Competiton offers some protection against such a possibility; so too might greater <strong>transparency</strong> over the principles used by dating apps to match people up.</p>
<p>Yet such concerns should not <strong>obscure</strong> the good that comes from the modern way of romance. The right partners can <strong>elevate</strong> and <strong>nourish</strong> each other. The wrong ones can ruin both their lives. Digital dating offers millions of people a more efficient way to find a good mate. That is something to love.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Matt Lees became a full-time YouTuber, he felt as if he had won the lottery. In February 2013, he had his first <strong>viral</strong> hit, an abridged version of Sony’s announcement of its PlayStation 4 vedio game <strong>console</strong>, dubbed with a cheerily <strong>acerbic</strong> commentary. Within days the video had been watched millions of times. The boost to Lees’ ego was nothing compared with the effect it had on his career. Overnight, Lees had what seemed like the first <strong>shoots</strong> of a sustainable career.</p>
<p>Excitement soon <strong>gave way to anxiety</strong>. Even in 2013, Lees was aware that his success depended not so much on smash hits as on day-by-day reliablity. “It’s not enough to simply create great things,” he says. “The audience expect consistency. They expect frequency.” By the end of the year Lees had grown his channel from 1,000 subscribers to 90,000, and caght the attention of one of his influences, Charlie Brooker, who invited Lees to collaborate on writing a Channel 4 special. For a month Lees worked 20-hour days, dividing his time between the TV script work and, ever conscious that missing a day’s upload could cause his videos to <strong>tumble down</strong> the search rankings, his YouTube channel.</p>
<p>At the end of the month he was pale, <strong>guant</strong> and tired in a way that, he recalls, seemed “<strong>impervious</strong> to rest”. Lees developed a <strong>thyroid</strong> problem, and persistent stretches of depression. “What started out as being the most fun job imaginable quickly slid into something taht felt deeply <strong>bleak</strong> and lonely,” he said.</p>
<p>Every time you log on to YouTube you are presented with videos chosen by the algorithm. The idea is that a clip particularly well suited to your tastes will inspire you to click the Subscribe button–which, hopefully, will bring you back to watch a new <strong>episode</strong> tomorrow. The viewer feels that YouTube understands what he or her likes, while advertisers are reassured that the vedio in front of which their five-second commercial will run will reach an appropriately targeted audience.</p>
<p>When your income is dependent on the number of people who watch your videos each week, this code can decide what, or even whether, you eat. And, 13 years into YouTube’s existence, many believe it has come it sit at the core of a growing mental health crisis among video creators.</p>
<p>In April this year there was a particularly extreme example, when 38-year-old Nasim Najafi Aghdam entered YouTube’s Californian campus and opened fire on employees with a 9mm <strong>pistol</strong>, wounding three before she killed herself. A video Aghdam uploaded <strong>prior to</strong> the attack suggested that it was dirven by her belief that the company’s algorithm has <strong>passed over</strong> her videos; in March she posted on Instagram, “All my YouTube channels got filtered by YouTube so my videos hardly get views.”</p>
<p>Algorithm-led content <strong>curation</strong> makes creators feel disposable, challenging them to <strong>churn out</strong> videos in the knowledge that there are younger, fresher people <strong>waiting in the wings</strong> to replace them.</p>
<p>At a recent party at a conference for YouTubers and streamers, Austin Hourigan, who runs ShoddyCast, a YouTube channel with 1.2 million subscribers, <strong>quipped</strong>: “I think every YouTube career should come with a <strong>coupon</strong> for a free therapist.”</p>
